## Introduction
This repository serves as a guide for the TechDemo of the Continuous Delivery (CD) course. It focuses on integrating CD principles into an existing software project rather than developing new software from scratch. The aim is to demonstrate automated builds, tests, and deployments in a real-world scenario.
