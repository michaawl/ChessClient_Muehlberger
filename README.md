## Introduction
This repository serves as a guide for the TechDemo of the Continuous Delivery (CD) course. It focuses on integrating CD principles into an existing software project rather than developing new software from scratch. The aim is to demonstrate automated builds, tests, and deployments in a real-world scenario.

## Objective
The main objective is to apply CD practices by automating key processes, ensuring a smoother and more efficient software development lifecycle. This includes:
- Automated builds with build tools.
- Automated testing with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Continuous deployment to production-like environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following software and tools are installed:
- **Git**: Version control.
- **Java JDK / Python / Node.js**: Depending on the tech stack used in your project.
- **Docker** (optional): For containerized deployments.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/continuous-delivery-techdemo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd continuous-delivery-techdemo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   - For Node.js:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For Python:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For Java:
     ```bash
     mvn install
     ```

## Usage
1. **Build the project**: 
   - Java: `mvn clean install`
   - Python: `python setup.py build`
   - JavaScript: `npm run build`

2. **Run the tests**:
   - Execute unit and integration tests to verify the functionality.

3. **Deploy the project**: The deployment is automated through the provided scripts or configured CI/CD pipeline.

## Tech Stack
- **Primary Language**: Java, Python, JavaScript (choose based on your project).
- **Build Tools**: Maven, Pip, NPM.
- **Testing Frameworks**: JUnit, pytest, Jest.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions.

## Testing
To ensure high-quality code, testing is integrated throughout the development process. You can run the following test suites:
1. **Unit Tests**: Validating individual components.
2. **Integration Tests**: Ensuring modules work together.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete workflows.
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Continuous Delivery Workflow
The following CD practices are integrated into this project:
- **Automated Builds**: Triggered on every commit.
- **Automated Tests**: Running unit, integration, and e2e tests.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deployments to a staging environment with approval steps for production deployment.
